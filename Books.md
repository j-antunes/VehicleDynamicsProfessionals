###  Race car vehicle dynamics by William F. Milliken

Overall a hard book that will make you an "expert" in vehicle dynamics. There is a lot of knowledge to be extract from the book. This book, more than any other, invites the reader without the requisite knowledge, and can result in a "expert". However, if someone wants to study Vehicle Dynamics correctly, it is prefered to start with books that cover vehicle automotive, instead of specific motorsport books.
The most important part of the book is chapter 5: Simplified Steady-State Stability and Control. it provides a lot of important concepts, from the basics of cornering to the derivative approach. However in the OEM (Original Equiment Manufacturer) BUNDORF was already the reference.

The part about load transfer: Steady-State Pair Analysis: Is a very important concept, however today there are books that are able to explain these concepts better.

Chapter 8: Force-Moment Analysis - It's a very interesting chapter that presents the concept of the Yaw Moment Diagram (YMD). It is a very interesting approach, however there are more efficient ways to extract this type of features of a vehicle.



Note: This book is a compedium of papers. It is a good pratice to also read them!
Note2: If one is interested in learning the YMD and the stability diagram it is recommended to get the SAE paper 760712 "THE STATIC DIRECTIONAL STABILITY AND CONTROL OF THE AUTOMOBILE"
